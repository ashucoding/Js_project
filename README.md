# Js_project

This application contains the basic blog layout with the ability to create and delete posts and comments. 

The idea behind this project was the created a travel blog where blog users can write their experiences about 
destinations they have traveled. 

I designed the blog page to be a single page application using JS CSS and HTML. 

Using scaffolding to build out the basic ruby rails files and then splitting into 2 category. 

Post_API Backend and Frontend.. JS, HTML and CSS

Once the server is running in rails(for database purposes)

You can right click on the index.html file and open with live server or open in browser. 

Once the application is up and running you can scroll to the bottom of the application and insert a post about 
your experience at such place. 

You have the ability to delete and other users have the ability to comment on your experience.
